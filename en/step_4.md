## What next?
In this project, you imported a unique data set, then trained a model to recognise the classes of data within that set and tested that it works. What you now do with your image recognition machine is up to you!

For example, you could:
- Add sounds to your project for each class
- Make the sprite change costume for each class
- Add more classes to your cloud model
- Create a project that requires a certain image to be shown to solve a riddle
- Make a game where you need to show a specific picture when prompted

If you are following the [Machine vision](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/machine-vision) pathway, you can move on to the [Funny face follower](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/funny-face-follower) project. In this project, you will make a cartoon mask that can detect your face and will follow it around the screen!
