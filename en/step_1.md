## Introduction

In this activity, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called teachable machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects! 

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this activity, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called Teachable Machine (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise a single image class (a hotdog) and tell you when it detects this image. 

You will be able to detect any image or object you like in your project. For this project, we used our Hacker Hotdog mascot.)
