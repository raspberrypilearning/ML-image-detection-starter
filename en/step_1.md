## Introduction

In this project, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called Teachable Machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects! 

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this project, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called Teachable Machine (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise a single image class (a hotdog) and tell you when it detects this image.

In this project, we have used a **Hotdog** mascot, but you will be able to detect any image or object you like in your project.
