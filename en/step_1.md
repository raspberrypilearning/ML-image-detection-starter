## Introduction

In this project, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called Teachable Machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects! 

**Remember that the image model that you are going to create will be stored on the cloud, so make sure that you have nothing that could identify your name or location in the shot, and get permission from your parents to create the model and use the camera first.**

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this project, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called Teachable Machine (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise a single image class (a hotdog) and tell you when it detects this image.

In this project, we have used a **Hotdog** mascot, but you will be able to detect any image or object you like in your project.
