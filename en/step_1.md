## Introduction

In this activity, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called teachable machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects! (In this case, it's our Hacker Hotdog mascot.)

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
In this activity, you will use a cloud-based machine learning engine called Teachable Machine (with Scratch!) to create a project that will recognise a single image class (a hotdog) and tell you when it detects this image.
