## Create a machine learning model

In this activity, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called Teachable Machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects!

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool created by Google that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. As this project requires connection to the cloud based machine learning engine, offline work is not possible.

Let’s get started!

We’re going to use it to create a Vision project, so navigate to the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train){:target="_blank"} site now and choose ‘Image Project’ from the three options:

What you can see here is your model **Workflow**:

We are going to add some classes on the left first. ‘Classes’ are the different sets of data we give our teachable machine.

Once we have created our datasets as classes, we will train our machine to recognise similarities and differences between our images in the class. 

Once trained, we’ll test and **export** your model so it can be used in Scratch!

Choose an object or picture to use as your subject. I used a printed out version of the Hacker Hotdog, but you could also use a toy or other image.

In the box labelled Class 1 click the button labelled ‘Webcam’.

Take the first of your three objects or images and hold it in front of your webcam.

Hold down the blue ‘record’ button and move your object around in front of the camera so it captures all sides and odd angles you can show the camera.

Try not to sit too still if you’re in the shot - it might mean the AI recognises you instead of the thing you want!
