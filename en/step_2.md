## Create a machine learning model

In this activity, you will use the amazing online machine learning engine called Teachable Machine with Scratch to create a project that will recognise different objects!

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool created by Google that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. As this project requires connection to the cloud based machine learning engine, offline work is not possible.
